## How to contribute
You can edit this file using GitHub's web interface, or fork the repository and work locally in your code editor.

2. Scroll down to the appropriate job position in the file to add your suggestion.
3. You can toggle from "Edit" mode into "Preview" mode at the top of the file editor to view your changes as they will appear.
4. After you make your changes, click the "Commit changes..." button in the upper right of the screen. You will be prompted to enter a commit message that will be used to describe the changes you have made. You may wish to edit this to convey more specific information to the repository maintainers (e.g. "Added a new speaker to README.md"), but this is not required. An extended description is not necessary.
5. Click the "Propose changes" button when you are happy with your submission. This will automatically create a fork of the repository in your GitHub account with the changes you have made.
6. Once you have committed your edits to your fork, follow the prompts to create a pull request (PR) which proposes changes to this repository.
